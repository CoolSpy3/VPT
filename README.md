# VPT
The Veteran Programming Test (hereafter referred to as VPT) was
born out of the desire to create a more comprehensive test of programming
knowledge. We do not dispute the validity of more traditional assessments
such as the AP test. However, we find these to be too focused on theory
and too abstract in their problems. (We think that they abstract away
the important complexity behind them).
